<h1>Azure Crash Course</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This tutorial goes over what Azure is and how to set it up to establish Virtual Machines that will be used in other tutorials. 


*Reminder: Azure is not the only cloud system that can be used to create virtual machines, but it will be the one we will use. 
<br/>


<h2>What is Azure? </h2>

Azure is a Microsoft cloud computing platform that allows users to use various tools to help build, deploy, and manage computer applications.

<h2>Why use Azure? </h2>

Understanding Azure is in high demand in IT Jobs and it allows users to create Virtual Machines, store information, use databases, and allow businesses to grow.

<h2>Tools needed to run Azure</h2>

- Computer with Internet Connection

- Credit Card (free credits when you first sign up)

<h2>Setting up Azure:</h2>

1. Using a computer with an internet connection, head to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ . Click on "Get Started with Azure".

4. After logging into your account (or creating your own account), you will be directed to the next page (shown in the next image). Continue with the sign up process, you might be asked to place your Credit Card information to start using Azure. Finish up signing up for your free trail.

<br />


<h2>Things to Consider</h2>

When you first sign up for Azure, you will be given a free trail option that will last 30 days from sign up and will allow you a $200 credit for you to use. The tutorials found on my github should not use all of the credit unless you create multiple virtual machines and allow them to continuously run.
