<h1>Setting up Azure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This tutorial explains what Azure is and guides you through the setup process to establish Virtual Machines for subsequent tutorials.

*Note: While Azure is a popular choice for creating virtual machines, it is not the only cloud platform available. For this tutorial, we will focus on Azure.* 
<br />

<h2>What is Azure?</h2>
Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, offering a range of tools to help users build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.

<h2>Why use Azure?</h2>
Azure is highly sought-after in IT roles, providing capabilities to create Virtual Machines, store data, manage databases, and support business growth.

<h2>Tools Needed for Azure</h2>


- A computer with an internet connection  
- A credit card (you will receive free credits upon signing up)

<br />

<h2>Things to Consider</h2>
When signing up for Azure, you will receive a 30-day free trial with $200 in credit. The tutorials on this GitHub repository are designed to minimize credit usage, provided you do not create multiple virtual machines or leave them running for extended periods.
